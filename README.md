# HTML & CSS Capstone Project

# An Online Shop For Musical Instrument

![](screenshot.png)

 This is an HTML & CSS Capstone Project,a real-world-like project, built with business specifications. A given design of a website was followed with specifications, but content was personalised. I have picked a musical instrument online shop for a more unique project the main reasons why I have chosen this project is to exercise my love for music and choosing this will be a great way to exploring the business aspect of it. A great way of making people have easy acces to the type of musical instrument they crave to buy, I aim at solving the problem of searching for a near by shop in town which you mayn't have an idea of, but just surfing through this little cart all you want is at your finger tip .
